**We'll explore two methods of getting data into your program:**

#1 Reading from an [input stream](./02-input-stream.md).  
#2 Reading from a [file](#).

**Note**  
I am personally not a fan of the teaching methods that start with useless or wrong examples and then move on to the right way. Throughout this tutorial, I will show a useful example line by line explaining what each line does before ending with the full example in working condition.

**Note**  
It requires a lot of extra effort, but instead of using github's dissapointing syntax coloring, I'm going to include images wherever example code is shown. This also makes you type the code yourself. It's a win win.
